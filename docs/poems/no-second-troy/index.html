<div class="poem">
    <p>Why should I blame her that she filled my days</p>
<p>With misery, or that she would of late</p>
<p>Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,</p>
<p>Or hurled the little streets upon the great,</p>
<p>Had they but courage equal to desire?</p>
<p>What could have made her peaceful with a mind</p>
<p>That nobleness made simple as a fire,</p>
<p>With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind</p>
<p>That is not natural in an age like this,</p>
<p>Being high and solitary and most stern?</p>
<p>Why, what could she have done, being what she is?</p>
<p>Was there another Troy for her to burn?</p>
