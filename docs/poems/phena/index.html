    <p><br/><br/>
at news of her death</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>Not a line of her writing have I</p>
<p>Not a thread of her hair,</p>
<p>No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby</p>
<p>I may picture her there;</p>
<p>And in vain do I urge my unsight</p>
<p>To conceive my lost prize</p>
<p>At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light</p>
<p>And with laughter her eyes.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>What scenes spread around her last days,</p>
<p>Sad, shining, or dim?</p>
<p>Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways</p>
<p>With an aureate nimb?</p>
<p>Or did life-light decline from her years,</p>
<p>And mischances control</p>
<p>Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears</p>
<p>Disennoble her soul?</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>Thus I do but the phantom retain</p>
<p>Of the maiden of yore</p>
<p>As my relic; yet haply the best of her--fined in my brain</p>
<p>It may be the more</p>
<p>That no line of her writing have I,</p>
<p>Nor a thread of her hair,</p>
<p>No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby</p>
<p>I may picture her there.</p>
