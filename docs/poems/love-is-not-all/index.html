<div class="poem">
    <p>Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink</p>
<p>Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;</p>
<p>Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink</p>
<p>And rise and sink and rise and sink again;</p>
<p>Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath,</p>
<p>Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;</p>
<p>Yet many a man is making friends with death</p>
<p>Even as I speak, for lack of love alone.</p>
<p>It well may be that in a difficult hour,</p>
<p>Pinned down by pain and moaning for release,</p>
<p>Or nagged by want past resolutionâ€™s power,</p>
<p>I might be driven to sell your love for peace,</p>
<p>Or trade the memory of this night for food.</p>
<p>It well may be. I do not think I would.</p>
