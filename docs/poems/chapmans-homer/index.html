<div class="poem">
    <p>Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,</p>
<p>And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;</p>
<p>Round many western islands have I been</p>
<p>Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.</p>
<p>Oft of one wide expanse had I been told</p>
<p>That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;</p>
<p>Yet did I never breathe its pure serene</p>
<p>Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:</p>
<p>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies</p>
<p>When a new planet swims into his ken;</p>
<p>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes</p>
<p>He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men</p>
<p>Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—</p>
<p>Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</p>
