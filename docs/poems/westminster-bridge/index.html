<div class="poem">
    <p>Earth has not anything to show more fair:</p>
<p>Dull would he be of soul who could pass by</p>
<p>A sight so touching in its majesty:</p>
<p>This City now doth, like a garment, wear</p>
<p>The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,</p>
<p>Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie</p>
<p>Open unto the fields, and to the sky;</p>
<p>All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.</p>
<p>Never did sun more beautifully steep</p>
<p>In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;</p>
<p>Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!</p>
<p>The river glideth at his own sweet will:</p>
<p>Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;</p>
<p>And all that mighty heart is lying still!</p>
