<div class="poem">
    <p>The ruth and truth you taught have come full-circle</p>
<p>On that fell island all whose history lies,</p>
<p>Far now from Bramhall Lane and far from Scarborough</p>
<p>You recollect how foolish are the wise.</p>
<p>On this great ground more marvellous than Lord's</p>
<p>- Time takes more spin than nineteen thirty four -</p>
<p>You face at last that vast that Bradman-shaming</p>
<p>Batsman whose cuts obey no natural law.</p>
<p>Run up again, as gravely smile as ever,</p>
<p>Veer without fear your left unlucky arm</p>
<p>In His so dark direction, but no length</p>
<p>However lovely can disturb the harm</p>
<p>That is His style, defer the winning drive</p>
<p>Or shake the crowd from their uproarious calm.</p>
<p><em>In memory of Captain Hedley Verity,(1905 - 1943) England and Yorkshire left arm bowler. He was taken prisoner of war and died in Caserta, Italy.</em></p>
