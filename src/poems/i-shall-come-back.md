title: I Shall Come Back
poet: Dorothy Parker

I shall come back without fanfaronade

Of wailing wind and graveyard panoply; 

But, trembling, slip from cool Eternity—

A mild and most bewildered little shade. 

I shall not make sepulchral midnight raid, 

But softly come where I had longed to be 

In April twilight's unsung melody, 

And I, not you, shall be the one afraid. 

Strange, that from lovely dreamings of the dead 

I shall come back to you, who hurt me most. 

You may not feel my hand upon your head, 

I'll be so new and inexpert a ghost. 

Perhaps you will not know that I am near,—

And that will break my ghostly heart, my dear.
