title: Verity

The ruth and truth you taught have come full-circle

On that fell island all whose history lies,

Far now from Bramhall Lane and far from Scarborough

You recollect how foolish are the wise.



On this great ground more marvellous than Lord's

- Time takes more spin than nineteen thirty four -

You face at last that vast that Bradman-shaming

Batsman whose cuts obey no natural law.



Run up again, as gravely smile as ever,

Veer without fear your left unlucky arm

In His so dark direction, but no length

However lovely can disturb the harm

That is His style, defer the winning drive

Or shake the crowd from their uproarious calm.

*In memory of Captain Hedley Verity,(1905 - 1943) England and Yorkshire left arm bowler. He was taken prisoner of war and died in Caserta, Italy.*
